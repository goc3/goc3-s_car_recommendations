# goc3-s_car_recommendations

This simple python programme aims to provide users my personal preferred vehicle recommendations, based on several criteria inputed by the user. It also works in two modes - quick, or elaborate, the second being more time consuming, but more precise as well. The project is (for now) consisted of a simple list (manually inputed by me), basically cars i deem "worthy" and can recommend, and the main.py script which runs the programme.
